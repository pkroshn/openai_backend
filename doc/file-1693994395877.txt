•	Where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of any workman because of punishment imposed by way of disciplinary action, the employer shall notify such workman in writing the reasons for the termination of employment before the expiry of the second working day after the date of such termination 
•	Non-employment of the workman, whether temporarily or permanently 
•	Non-employment of the workman in such employment in consequence of the closure by his employer of any trade, industry or business. 
•	Any sum of money (up to Rs 2.5 million) to be paid as compensation to a workman on decision made by the Commissioner under this Act shall be computed in accordance with such formula is to be determined by the Commissioner, in consultation with the Minister, by Order published in the gazette.
